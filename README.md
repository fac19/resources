## How to add a resource

In order to keep some semblance of order in this library, please add your resource to the correct category, and make sure it includes the following things.

- link to the specific page
- short description of why it's cool/life-saving
- the GitHub handle of the person who shared it (who do we send the flowers to?)

#### Example
